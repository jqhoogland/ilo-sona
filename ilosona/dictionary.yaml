    noun: fruit, vegetable, mushroom

- kin (nimi ku suli):
    particle: very, really, also
    notes: In the first official book, this word was merged with “a”. However, many people use it separately from “a”. They would only use “a” to emphasize someone’s feelings.

- kipisi (nimi ku suli):
    verb: to cut, to divide
    notes: This is an old word that was not included in the first official book, but which many people still use. Those who want to only use lipu pu vocabulary might want to use “tu”, which can also be used as a verb to mean “to divide”, the same way “wan” means “to unite”.

- ku (nimi ku suli):
    noun: the Toki Pona Dictionary by Sonja Lang

    notes: Much like interacting with the first official toki pona book was given the word “pu”, so does the second book with “ku”. In fact, in lipu ku, words “ju”, “lu”, “nu”, “su” and “u” are all listed as “(word reserved for future use by Sonja Lang)”, presumably to be given to the next five official toki pona books that (in my opinion) should be created in the future.

- la:
    particle: if/when (introduces context)

- lanpan (nimi ku suli):
    verb: to get, to take, to steal
    notes: Without this word, the typical way to express getting or taking something would be “kama jo e …” (to come into possession of …), possibly with additional adjectives like “ike” or “utala”. The word is famously used in the title of “lanpan pan”, the toki pona translation/summary of Peter Kropotkin’s “The Conquest of Bread”.

    noun: woman, female, wife
    adjective: feminine

- meso (nimi ku suli):
    noun: middle, center
    adjective: average, moderate, mediocre
    notes: In some ways, this word is similar to “insa”, but it also lets people say that a thing is moderately X without having to use phrases like “ona li wawa mute ala, li wawa lili ala”.

- mi:
    noun: i, me, we, us
    adjective: my, our

- mije:
    noun: man, male, husband
    adjective: masculine

- misikeke (nimi ku suli):
    noun: medicine, cure
    adjective: medicinal
    verb: to cure
    notes: This word was invented by Sonja Lang, but was not included as part of lipu pu. (My personal guess is because “ijo pi pona sijelo” is a rather simple way to say “medicine” without it.)

    noun: death

    adjective: many, more
    number: 3 or more (simple system), 20 (complex system)

- n (nimi ku suli):
    interjection: um…, hm… (“thinking noise”)
    notes: Technically, the word “n” breaks the rules of toki pona by using a non-allowed syllable, but as it basically functions as a word on its own, it’s allowed. Or one can interpret syllable-final “n” as a separate mora, like in Japanese, where “n” on its own is apparently also used as an interjection…

- namako (nimi ku suli):
    noun: spice, addition
    adjective: additional, extra
    verb: to add, to spice up
    notes: In the first official book, this word was merged with “sin”. However, many people keep using it separately from “sin”. “sin” is interpreted to mean “new” and “namako” to mean “additional”.
